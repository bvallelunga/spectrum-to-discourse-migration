# spectrum-to-discourse-migration

If you're looking for help migrating your Spectrum data into Discourse, look no further.

## Setup and installation

These scripts are just a bunch of Python files configured to run from the command line and take CSV files as arguments. We've included a `virtualenv` with all of the dependencies pre-installed. If you want to install them yourself, you'll need:

- Python 3+
- pandas
- requests

The rest of the libraries we're using (`json`, `sys`, `time`) should all be included with Python by default.
